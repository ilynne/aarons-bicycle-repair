<P><H2>Questions & Statements for Seattle's Politicians</H2>
<UL>
<LI>No more debate, Seattle needs fast mass transit. Build the Monorail NOW! The time for talking is over. I want you to do everything you can to get it rolling.<P>

<LI>Light Rail, Ditto above.<P>

<LI>How can we get more people to ride bicycles for transportation?<P>

<LI>Close one street downtown to private automobile use. How about 3rd Avenue?<P>

<LI>Put more busses in the Bus Tunnel! Open it 24 hours a day and police it.<P>

<LI>Regarding renewable energy sources. Are you paying extra on your personal utility bill from Seattle City Light for wind power? If not, then why not?
<BR>You can sign up at the <A href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/light/green/greenpower" >City Light webpage</A><P>

<LI>Let's start Tax Shifting! Raise the Gas tax and lower the Sales Tax. Once explained to people, there is strong support.<P>

<LI>Seattle is the birthplace of fast-food coffee (starbucks). The waste generated by them is appalling! The paper cups are our forests! Let's ban all disposable (one way) beverage containers. Restaurants will adapt and new jobs will be created. Litter will be massively reduced and air pollution will be reduced. Fuel costs will be reduced and energy & materials making cans/bottles/cups will be saved. A bottle bill is way over due.
<BR>Denmark and Finland both have banned disposable beverage containers.
<BR>As a first step, make it illegal to drink coffee in a paper (diposable) cup inside the place it was served.<P>

<LI>Stop the 3rd runway at Seatac. By the time it is built it will not be needed! Airline travel is declining. Airplane travel is destroying the planet. Recent observations of the 3 days of no air travel after 9-11 confirm that airplane contrails are cooling the upper atmosphere but warming the lower atmosphere. We must stop traveling so much. It is totally unsustainable. Encourage telecommuting and teleconferencing. Give businesses tax breaks for limiting employee travel. The money they save will be spent here, bolstering our local economy.<P>

<LI>Let it be known that having only one child is the environmentally responsible thing to do. Our population is increasing faster than the government and the environment can provide services. Let it be known that a stable population is better for the economy. Garbage is a good example: If we recycle 50% of our trash, but double our population, we are back at square one. The same can be said for energy, roads (congestion), schools (class size), etc.<P>

<LI>If we can afford 2 new sports stadiums, surely we can afford to solve our homeless/street people problem. We need a public halfway house to help these people. One building. Some may not wish help, but many do. No one should have to sleep outside. We treat our dogs better than our homeless. <P>

<LI>Other tasks: 
<BR>The city glass recycling trucks spill glass on the streets. Solution?
<BR>Let it be known that automobiles are in direct conflict with city life.
<BR>Plant more trees. 
<BR>Dispell the business myth of grow or die.
<BR>Teach recycling in school.
<BR>Start an anti-littering campaign (remember Woodsy the owl?) Learning not to litter is the first step in environmental awareness!
<BR>Encourage people to live within 5 miles of work
<BR>Send a message about conserving electricity by turning out the lights in Safeco Field and the new Seahawks Stadium at night! Get the news media in on it.
<BR>Enforce the ban on fireworks within Seattle or repeal the law.

<LI>Getting people out of cars will make the Alaskan Way Viaduct unneeded! Tear it down and do not replace it. Build a park where it stood. Spend the money fixing the seawall only. Porland, Oregon is a perfect example of how it can be done.<P>
<UL>
<P>The choices we make this generation will affect all generations to come. Let's make good ones.
