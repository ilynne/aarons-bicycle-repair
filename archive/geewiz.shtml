<P><B>This ride has been post-poned untill the spring of 2002

<P><B>Most Saturday mornings Gypsie will lead an easy road ride around West Seattle. We leave <i>promptly</i> at 9:00 AM from the <A HREF ="aerialphoto.shtml">shop</A>. The pace is kept easy and the length is less than 15 miles.  This is a very good ride for beginners or those just wanting to enjoy the morning and some good comradeship.  There is usually one regroup/rest stop to enjoy the scenery......or grab a latte!
 <P> This is a <A HREF ="http://www.cascade.org"> Cascade Bicycle Club</A> ride. Helmets are required!
<P>Please call (206) 938-9795 or <A HREF="mailto:gypsie@rideyourbike.com">email</A> (gypsie@rideyourbike.com) to R.S.V.P.</B>
