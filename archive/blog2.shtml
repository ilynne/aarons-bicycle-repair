<P>We are busy assembling bicycles and putting the final touches on the new shop.  There is still a ton to do, but less everyday.  The cats are after us to install the cat door in the bathroom so they can use their litter box.  The cats now stay in the main shop at night so stop by and say hi after hours.  Presta often sits in the north door way.  Plus if someone ever breaks in, the will now get loved to death by Schrader!  We hope the new awning stems the tide of people coming in saying, "Where's the liquor store?"   We have taken to having a little fun with people, but it is nice to have a steady stream of folks coming in.  We may start selling the airline size bottles.

<P>WE ARE MOVING......AGAIN!  Thank you to the State of Washington Liquor Control Board for not renewing their lease at the Morgan Junction liquor store!  Our landlord was more than happy to give us the lease.  We will be doubling our space with 4 times more back storage! As of September 20th, 2008 you will have to get your booze in the Alaska Junction.  Look for us to be fully moved in by December 1st.  Our new address will be 6527 California Avenue SW.  Everything else will be the same.    We will have the room to stock complete bikes, and other large bulky items like trailers, baskets, bags, trail-a-bikes, etc.

<P>WOW!  This has been the busiest summer we can ever remember.  We heard tales of 1972-74 (the Bike Boom) and we can imagine this as a similar time.  Gas prices are high and everyone wants a bike.   Well not everyone, the streets are still clogged with cars and the gas pumps have no lines.....yet.   This summer has been somewhat mild and a little rain and falling gas prices (now under $4) have damped (or dampened) the demand for bikes and repair, but still business is good.  That is why we have not blogged in over  a month.   Come see our empty shelves (just kidding, but it is a challenge to keep goods in stock) and busy mechanics.   Big Dummies are back in stock as are Xtracycles (soon) and Brooks saddles.  Hey, we even got  a shipment of 27" tires and 700C tubes!

<blockquote>
RCW 46.61.790
Intoxicated bicyclists.  

(1) A law enforcement officer may offer to transport a bicycle rider who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or any drug and who is walking or moving along or within the right-of-way of a public roadway, unless the bicycle rider is to be taken into protective custody under RCW 70.96A.120. The law enforcement officer offering to transport an intoxicated bicycle rider under this section shall:

     (a) Transport the intoxicated bicycle rider to a safe place; or

     (b) Release the intoxicated bicycle rider to a competent person.

     (2) The law enforcement officer shall not provide the assistance offered if the bicycle rider refuses to accept it. No suit or action may be commenced or prosecuted against the law enforcement officer, law enforcement agency, the state of Washington, or any political subdivision of the state for any act resulting from the refusal of the bicycle rider to accept this assistance.

     (3) The law enforcement officer may impound the bicycle operated by an intoxicated bicycle rider if the officer determines that impoundment is necessary to reduce a threat to public safety, and there are no reasonable alternatives to impoundment. The bicyclist will be given a written notice of when and where the impounded bicycle may be reclaimed. The bicycle may be reclaimed by the bicycle rider when the bicycle rider no longer appears to be intoxicated, or by an individual who can establish ownership of the bicycle. The bicycle must be returned without payment of a fee. If the bicycle is not reclaimed within thirty days, it will be subject to sale or disposal consistent with agency procedures.

<BR>Shimano FFS freewheels had independently freewheeling cogs.  They were sort of a fail safe device in case the front freewheel locked up, the bike would not turn into a fixed gear.

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have, perhaps, the burliest repair stands on Earth!  The Park double arm repair stands served us well for 11 years.  However, we needed the stands to NOT  MOVE when one mechanic is wrenching hard (eg. tightening a bottom bracket) on one side and the other is trying to do something delicate (eg. putting loose ball bearings in a headset).  
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron went to the metal yard and found the biggest telescoping tubes he could find. Then he called <A Href="http://www.parktool.com" >Park Tool</A> and asked if we could buy just the top part of the PRS-2 stands and the lock-block mechanisms.  Our shop landlord, Kenny, welded it all together. Sawyer had the idea to paint them yellow. We upgraded to <A Href="http://www.efficientvelo.com" >Effecient Velo Tools</A> Right Arm Repair Clamps. Finally a hole was drilled thru the upper tube and a shaft with two R4 cartridge bearings on each side. These roll on the top of the lower tube and allow the stand to rotate 360 degrees. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stands are 56" tall to the center of the cross member.  The lower tube is 4" outside diameter and the upper tube is 3 1/2" O.D. Wall thickness is 1/4". Base plate dimensions are 1/2" x 10" square. Carpet has been wrapped around the bases to protect the top tube if  the bike ever falls against the stand. It doubles as a scratching post for our <A Href="shopcats.shtml" >shop cats</A>, Presta and Schrader!

We already are able to service the hubs externally and replace the axle bearings, do oil changes, etc.  We stock all the normal external replacement parts, oil, cogs, and tools to maintain your hub.  The big news will be if the folks in Germany will sell Rohloff USA the special tools needed to service the guts of the hub.   The large hub bearings can fail and right now, you have to send your hub to Germany for repair.  It would be nice if it could be done here in the USA!

<P align="justify"><A href="http://www.deepfeet.com" >Ashiatsu</A> is the deepest <A href="http://www.rideyourbike.com/massage" >massage</A> you'll ever receive. The technique is done with the feet. I do not walk on your back, I keep one foot on the table while I do deep soothing effleurage strokes on the body. Also working here on Wednesdays is <A href="http://www.sweetfeetbodyworks.com" >Dari Haffie</A>, the northwest's only certified instructor in this technique.

<P align="justify"><A href="http://www.interlocracing.com" >Interloc Racing Design</A> (aka IRD) has developed new high quality freewheels!  We stock all sizes!  We also plan on stocking Phil Wood freewheel hubs.  Ebay has for years been the best place to find rare or NOS (new old stock) bicycle parts.  We keep our SunTour Winnner Pro cog board stocked from Ebay.  However, it costs $75 to $100 for a SunTour freehweel, which makes these IRD freewheels a bargain at $50.  They really are top quality and even have shifting ramps!

<P>Update, Our lathe is almost ready!  Just waiting on one final replacement part and we are in business!
<P align="justify"><font color=blue> Originally posted Winter 2004</font> Recently the shop purchased a South Bend 9" metal lathe. Aaron is in the process of cleaning and painting it. It will look better than new when he is done. There are a lot of parts to a lathe! It was made in the USA in the early 1940s. The amazing thing is that all replacement parts are still available for it. You just don't see that much in todays throw-away society. We love that because fixing and repairing things is what we do. We will be able to make replacement parts for obscure bikes and machine worn parts like headsets, bottom brackets and hubs.

<BR>Pat. Pend.

<p Align=justify>This product was an accident. The guy that makes them needed a kickstand extension because his was cut too short. It turned out to make the bike more stable and it looks cool. They look like a horse's hoof. Kind of cool considering the Bicycle is also known as the Iron Horse! They will last for years (your kickstand probably will break first). The material is called Nylatron and contains Molybdenm. It gives it a nice metalic satin look.

<p Align=justify>The Free Radical is a bike extension made by Xtracycle. It converts any 26" wheeled bike into a cargo hauling machine. The handling of the bike is made more stable yet still nimble and manuverable. The added weight is only 10 pounds, yet the bike is capable of carrying 500 pounds! This picture is of our rental bike outfitted with one. Come test ride one anytime. Converting your bike will require a V-brake in the rear. Cost for a good one with adapter is under $60.  If your bike already has V-brakes, no problem.
