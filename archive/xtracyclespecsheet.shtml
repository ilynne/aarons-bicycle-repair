<P align="justify">Notes & Thoughts: 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above lists are, of course, just suggestions. There are <i>way</i> too many options with bicycles to list them all.  These are parts we stock and have had good luck with. They are durable and offer good value for the price. Everyone that works at ABR rides an Xtracycle (except Mikey). We have built several deluxe Xtracycles for over $5,000!  It makes sense to spend that kind of money if you are replacing a car.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have helped over 50 people build their Xtracycles.  Most of our customers eventually switch to upright handlebars.  High handlebars are great for climbing Seattle's hills because they allow you to lean back and pull on the handlebars.  The long wheelbase of the Xtracycle prevents the front wheel from lifting off the ground!  With heavy loading and steep hills you will need  powerfull, durable and reliable brakes.  Hayes disc brakes have proven themselves to be just that!  However, if your villa is not so hilla, then you can substitue a V-brakes. Understand, though that your rims will wear out sooner. Standard, old fashioned cantilevers will also work fine on the front.  Another option is a SRAM or Sturmey Archer front drum brake hub for the ultimate in low maintenance. However, the braking power is different and you will need to ride the brakes on steep hills. Drum brakes can handle extreme heat build up without fading.  Sturmey Archer even makes a model with a Dynamo for your lights!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use a 36 hole rear hub then we recommend heavy duty spokes.  Phil Wood makes 13-14 gauge single butted spokes with the thick end at the elbow.
