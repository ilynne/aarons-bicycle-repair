<P align=justify>Bicycle suspension technology changes about as fast as personal computers.  While it is not impossible it is very unprofitable for any shop to stock all the tools and parts needed to service every shock out there.  Fork makers generally discontinue stocking replacement parts after 3 years (notable exceptions are Fox and Marzocchi). Some suspenisons are not user or shop serviceable and some require very expensive tools.   Rock Shox, specifically, has a local service center in Kent, Washington at Seattle Bike Supply.  Val Kleitz is the Rock Shox Service and Warranty Manager there.  He also works here on Sundays.  Newer and higher quality Rock Shox are generally serviceable and upgradeable (SID for example).

<P>Many older forks, however, are still serviceable (even Rock Shock's first fork the RS1). An oil change is recommended for any Air/Oil type fork every 50-100 hours of use. Elastomer and Spring forks should be cleaned out and re-lubed with special grease. Forks older than 5 years should also have thier oil changed.  If we cannot do the service, then we recommend <A Href="http://www.hippiesuspension.com/hippietechsuspension" >Hippie-Tech Suspension</A> or <A Href="http://www.pushindustries.com" >Push Industries</A>.

<P align="justify"><B>We use <A Href="http://www.bardahl.com" >Bardahl</A> multi-weight or custom weight synthetic suspension fluid. Not only is it made in Ballard, but it is of the highest quality and compatable with all suspension systems.

<P>In addition to servicing suspension forks and rear shocks, the suspension linkage needs occasional service.  High quality full suspension frames usually use cartridge bearings of which we stock most.  Older suspenion arms may use bushings, and you will need to call the bicycle manufacturer to see if parts are still available (many are).
