<p><b><font  color=red size=+1>If the leather is torn, you need a new saddle! </font> 
<BR>We are not responsible for saddles that tear during repair. Leather is dead cow skin and constant external moisturizing is required.  We have fixed hundreds of saddles successfully, but occasionally the leather will tear during the riveting process.  Installing new rivets involves using an anvil and a hammer! Installing a new nose bolt involves a long lever to stretch the leather and sometimes a hammer.  Sometimes the leather will tear during this process.  We just never know.  
<P>WE ONLY ONLY REPLACE RIVETS WITH COPPER (even the steel ones).
<P>Send saddles at your own risk!

<p><b>Leather kept lubricated and moisturized with <a href="http://www.brooksengland.com">Proofide</a> or <a href="http://www.obenaufs.com">Obeanuf's Heavy Duty LP</A> will not normally tear!  If you can see flaky or fuzzy leather, then perhaps your saddle is done.  We cannot always see these details from the pictures you send in.  The top should be smooth.  When you scratch the bottom with your fingernail you should not be able to remove any material and any mark should be minor.  If you can dig into the leather and leave a significant mark then the leather is dying.  Not all leather is the same and sometimes even dead leather can be restored with oil.  We just never know until we start the job.
<P>If your saddle leather tears during repair, the minimum charge is $30 which includes shipping your saddle back to you.
<P>We always oil the repair area and often this will darken the leather. It cannot be avoided so we usually oil the entire saddle to make it look even.  Light honey colored saddles, especially will darken.
