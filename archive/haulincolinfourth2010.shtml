<P>Meet at the Pergola at First and Yesler in Pioneer Square at noon, leave at 1 PM.  The destination is <A HREF="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=rxswmg4t3q9x&style=o&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=11077325&encType=1">Terminal 107</A>, a very pleasant park hidden among the industry along the Duwamish waterway.  We'll stop at  Uwajimaya for supplies, then take a tour
of the bike path that follows the new light rail tracks,  head west
across the West Seattle Bridge and south along West Marginal Way to the park.
