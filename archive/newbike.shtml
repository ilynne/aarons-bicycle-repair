<BR>New Bike Purchase Benefits</H1>


<BR><B>We take the time to assemble your bike right! Simply put, a bicycle purchased from us will <BR>last longer and work better than the same bike bought elsewhere! <A HREF ="bikeassembly.shtml"> Here's why.</A>

<UL>
<LI>Professional Bike Fitting and Print-Out</LI>
<LI>Adjustment and <i>Application</i> of Bike Fitting to your new bike</LI>
<LI>FREE Tune-Up after 60-Days or 200 miles (which ever comes <i>last</i> )</LI>
<LI>One Year Warranty on all parts and labor.</LI>
<LI>Lifetime Warranty<sup>*</SUP> on the Frame and Rigid Forks.</LI>
<LI>Priority Service on any repair the first year</LI>
</UL>


<P><sup>*</SUP> Most warranties cover the 'realistic lifetime' of the bike, not the lifetime of the user! Many manufacturers have a 5 year expected lifetime for aluminum bikes. We will work with you to resolve any problem at minimal cost to you should you ever have a problem.
