<P><B>Bring it in and see if we can fix it for you.  We have many tools at our disposal.  We are creative in fixing just about anything.  We work with a local bicycle oriented machine shop   <A Href="http://www.haulincolin.com">CycleFAB</A> that can weld, machine or create just about any metal part needed. We are also experts at finding parts for things online.

<P>Examples of items we have repaired:


<P>Air Compressors
<BR>Auto Jack Oil Change (hydraulic floor model, see picture below)

<P>*We are not a skate shop but can intall your elswere purchased wheels, trucks and brearings.  We do not install griptape.  We recommend <A href="http://www.alkibikeandboard.com">Alki Bike and Board</A>.


<P>If it is portable and made of metal give us a shot.
<br>Also, we can often fix bicycles or parts that other shops say are not repairable.

<br>Think of us for your small metric bolt and nut needs.  We have a better selection than the hardware store!

<P>We also offer <A HREF="workbenchrental.shtml" target=right>DIY Bike Repair</A> space.
