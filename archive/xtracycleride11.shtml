<P><H2>HOT STUFF Cargo Bike Ride</H2>
</center>

<P><H3>MANY OF YOU HAVE NOTED THAT THE DESTINATION WAS OMITTED.  IT IS JUST AS WELL, BECAUSE WE DID NOT END UP GOING TO WOODLAND PARK AS PLANNED.  WE ENDED UP AT GASWORKS PARK INSTEAD. 
<p>FUTURE RIDES WILL HAVE A SUGGESTED AREA OF TOWN WITH THE FINAL DESTINATION LEFT OPEN TO THE GROUP TO DECIDE.

<P>Friday, November 23<sup>th</sup>, 2007 at 12 Noon [aka <A HREF="http://www.adbusters.org/metas/eco/bnd" >Buy Nothing Day</A>] by the Pig at the entrance to the Pike Place Market.</H3>

<P align="justify"><b>Now how in the heck do we not buy anything?  We will be 'protesting' the use of cars and mass consumption just by riding bikes, however, this is not a protest ride, just a fun ride.  We will be leading by example that one can have fun without  internal combustion, but the main focus is fun and enjoying the bicycle and the great outdoors.  So if we buy something (like coffee) so be it.  


<P>BRING HOT STUFF!  Coffee, tea, soup, chili, clam chowder, hot spiced cider, mulled wine, hot cocoa, etc.




<P>Look for Xtracycles, Trailers, Front Racks, Rear Racks, Panniers, <A HREF="http://www.bakfiets.nl" >Bakfiets</A>, Porter Bikes, Messenger Bags, etc. Any and all bikes and cyclists welcome!

<P align="justify">If you don't know what an Xtracycle is then click <A HREF="xtracycle.shtml" >here</A> or go to <A HREF="http://www.xtracycle.com" >Xtracycle.com</A> This ride is not just for Xtracyclers. All bikers, cyclists, riders and passengers are invited! This ride is all about the usefulness of the bicycle.  Cargo hauling is THE key feature of the Xtracycle and since it is still a bicycle it is very fun to ride!
