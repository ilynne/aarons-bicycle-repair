<H1>The saddle is the most important part of the bike!</H1>
<P><B>We cary seats by <A Href="http://www.brookssaddles.com" >Brooks</A>, <A Href="http://www.serfas.com" >Serfas</A>.

<P>We want you to <i>ride!</i> That is why we have our Comfort Guaranteed Seat Policy. <P>If the Serfas seat you buy isn't comfortable, then you can <i>exchange</i> it for another model. Damaged seats will not be exchanged.
<P>The policy does not apply to Brooks saddles.  Buying a Brooks saddle is a different expereince and is a leap of faith that it will be comfortable in the long run. Somewhat like a quality pair of leather shoes.  If you buy a Brooks, you won't be sorry!

<P>We prefer <A Href="http://www.obenaufs.com" >Obenauf's</A> LP over Brooks Proofhide.  Every Brooks we sell, we pre-treat with Obenauf's LP Oil.  This one time treatment, softens the leather and shortens the break-in period.  Leather is skin and needs you to give it the moisture the cow once did!  Obenauf's comes in 1 ounce tubs and we offer <A Href="refills.shtml" >refills</A>.

<BR>We also offer rail and rivet replacement.  See the pictures below for example of repaird saddles.
