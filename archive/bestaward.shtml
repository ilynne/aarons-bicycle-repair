</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEATTLE, WA - The Business and Industry Resource Venture and its program partners honored Aaron's Bicycle Repair today at the first annual Seattle<B> </B>BEST Awards Breakfast Ceremony at the W Hotel in Seattle. The West Seattle-based business was one of seven local companies who received BEST (Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow) Awards.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aaron's Bicycle Repair, 6521 California SW, recycles more than 90 percent of their waste. They participate in the City of Seattle Small Business Curbside Recycling Program, which means that they recycle a wide variety of common recyclables for free. To make recycling easy for his employees, owner Aaron Goss placed four five-gallon buckets under the workbench. Each bucket is used to hold different recyclable materials: bicycle chains and gears; glass, plastic and mixed paper; scrap iron; and scrap aluminum. A fifth five-gallon bucket is used for garbage, and it takes over a week to fill it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aaron Goss collects food waste from shop employees and takes it home to compost it or feed it to his chickens. The shop also accepts the following items from its customers for recycling: dry-cell batteries, freewheels, chains, scrap bicycle iron and aluminum, mountain bike inner tubes and tires ($1 fee per tire).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To promote waste prevention, shop employees encourage customers to purchase products that can be reused, like rechargeable light systems and patch kits for leaky inner tubes. The company also promotes waste prevention and recycling through its Web site, www.rideyourbike.com.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aaron's has been a five star member of the EnviroStars program since 1997.</P>
