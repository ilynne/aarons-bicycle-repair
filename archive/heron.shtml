<P><font color="red">As of September 19, 2007 Heron bikes have been discontinued however, some stock is still available.</Font>

<P align="justify">We are delighted to annouce that <A HREF="http://www.heronbicycles.com" >Heron Bicycle</A> frames are back in production, and we have them!   They're still made in Wisconsin by <A HREF="http://www.waterfordbikes.com" >Waterford Precision Cycles</A>, using traditional lugged construction.


<p align="justify">We are proud to have been selected as one of the few shops to sell the excellent Heron frames.  The frames are designed by the legendary Grant Petersen, and hand-crafted by Waterford Precision in Wisconsin.  They are constructed of classic Reynolds 531, joined by elegant lugs.

<P><H2>The Heron Touring Frame</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/heron/touring.jpg" width=383 height=211 align = "right" hspace=30>
<P align="justify">A good all-purpose rough-stuff bike. The stout frame, and good clearances for mud, fat tires and fenders make it ideal for trail riding and bad-weather/bad-road riding. It's smooth and stable by virtue of its wheelbase and steering geometry, but no way does it feel like a station wagon. It corners hard and fast without any wrestling, and you don't have to wrestle it into compliance like you do with a lot of road bikes. It'll build up into a wonderful bike for commuting, long distance riding, or light trail riding. If all your bikes are road bikes and none of them accommodate fenders or racks and so are pretty useless in the winter, why not get a Heron Touring and ride a bike with a different personality for a few months out of the year? You'll stay clean, at least, and you'll probably ride it half the time when the weather's perfect, too. 

<P align="justify">For true, loaded touring, this frame is perfect. The clearances
are right for fat tires and fenders, and it's a rigid enough frame to handle heavy loads
without squawking.

<P><H2>The Heron Road Frame</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/heron/road.jpg" width=371 height=221 align = "left" hspace=30>
<P align="justify">A Heron Road is unusually versatile for a high performance, sporty frame. 
You can put fenders on it or ride it with
700x35s on bad roads and fire trails, and you can race it on a
smooth course. Grant's priorities were to design a versatile,
all-around road frame that you can ride on any surface, and
one that offers more comfort - by means of a proper riding
position - than 99 percent of the frames you can shake a stick
at.
