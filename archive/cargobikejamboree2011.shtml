<P>Meet near the Pike Place Pig <A Href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014139168_apwaseattlepigcrash.html">(she should be back from the hospital)</A> and ride to <A Href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=460" target = right>Lincoln Park</A> in West Seattle, a totally flat ride! (Well, almost flat, just some very tiny short easy hills like the lower West Seattle Bridge). 
<P>This is a stick-together ride and there will be one refueling/supplies stop at 7-11 along Harbor Avenue for supplies and ice for the bike blended smoothies! This is our <A Href="http://tinyurl.com/3mbe23v">approximate route</A>
, but subject to the group's whim.

<P>If you want to meet us there, we will be at shelter <A Href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/picnic_detail.asp?id=460#_shelter18" target = right>#3</A> on the south beach around 3 PM.  

<P>Look for <A HREF="xtracycle.shtml">Xtracycles</A>, Trailers, Front Racks, Rear Racks, Panniers, <A HREF="http://www.dutchbikeseattle.com" >Bakfiets</A>, Porter Bikes, Messenger Bags, etc., etc.

<P><H1>ALL BIKES WELCOME</h1>

<P>Help promote this ride with this <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUZnNj5MzIGF6hHADZ98dsTq7bOpnVnbilHkWkeeLuQ/edit?hl=en&authkey=CJW3mZ4D

<P>Watch the video below to get a sense of what a cargo bike ride is like:

<P>Cargo hauling is fun especially if you are cargo!
<BR>Speaking of cargo, please note, we pack out all recyclables!
