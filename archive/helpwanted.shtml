<P><BR>Email Resume and Cover Letter to <A HREF="mailto:aaron@rideyourbike.com"> aaron@rideyourbike.com </A>

<P>We do not accept 'snailmail' resumes as using a computer is required to work at our shop and emailling a resume is initial proof that you can. You do not need to own a computer. The public library has them as well as many internet cafes. Heck, you can even use one of ours when you visit the shop!


<P><H2><font color="green">Shop Description</font></H2>

<P align = "justify">Aaron's Bicycle Repair is an open atmosphere repair shop (the repair benches are not hidden in a back room). We sell bikes, helmets, limited clothing (gloves and socks) and all parts & accessories but primarily focus on quality repair.  Our motto about Tune-ups is - <i>Your bike will work better than new!</i>  We do it right the first time. The repair benches are the first thing the customer sees when coming in the door.  The customer is welcome anywhere in the shop except in the immediate repair bench area and behind the cash wrap. We strive to make folks feel comfortable and don't use technobabble unless the customer speaks it first (i.e. we call the BB the "crank bearing"). West Seattle is like a small town and we know a lot of customers by first name.   We have a book library where customers can borrow books on all things bike.  Our customers are a mix of families, commuters, MTBers, Roadies and women! The people of White Center / West Seattle are very laid back and there is much variety in the people we serve.  We love quality beer and good coffee.  Big Al Brewing is right across the street and the Hung Long Asian Market is the anchor to the strip mall we are in.  It doesn't feel like a strip mall because we are on the corner.  Lots of windows and light!

<P> 5 + years experience. Master mechanics often have their own shop.  This can include personal shops, previously owned shops, or a current bike shop. If they do not have a shop, they live and breathe mechanics day and night. It is their favoirte thing!  Not all shop owners are master mechanics, however.  Peer recognition and respect are required.  There is no official certification program in the bicycle industry.  Presenting these suggestions we hope to change that.   Electricians, plumbers and auto mechanics all have similar definitions.  The field of bicycle mechanics is just as technical if not more so. Higher wages for mechanics and attracting career minded employees are the goals.

<P align = "justify"><sup>1</sup> Caring for the environment and recycling is important if humanity is to continue to exist. It is EVERYONES job! It includes making adjustments to your work life AND your home life. It means doing things like recycling, considering the packaging your purchases come in, taking a bag to the store, or your own cup to get coffee.
<BR>Using less energy is very important. Right now humanity uses way more energy than the earth provides. We are using hundreds of years worth of energy (in the form of fossil fuel) every day. It cannot go on much longer. Change the light bulbs in your house to compact flourecant. Turn off lights when not needed, wear a sweater when it is cold.


<P align = "justify"><sup>2</sup>Driving a car is bad for the planet. The less we do of it the better. Riding a bike doesn't hurt the planet at all. Not even a scratch! Everyone can ride a bike, or a trike or a recumbent or a recumbent trike or a hand cycle. The point is we are a transportation oriented shop not a recreational one. Our main goal is to encourage bike use for  daily transport. If you are unable to ride sometimes, take the bus! Three times a week is easy and you <i>and</i> the planet will feel better.
