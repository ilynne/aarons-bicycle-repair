<P Align="justify">A word about stolen bikes: By Seattle city law, any shop that buys a bike from an individual for resale is considered a Used Goods Dealer and must have a used goods license ($130 per year). You can ask to see their Seattle Business License (it should be displayed prominently). They should have records of who they purchased the bike from and a copy of their ID on file.  If you find your bike at a shop and you still have your original purchase reciept and the serial number AND you filled out a police report when your bike was stolen, then your should be able to get your bike back.
<BR><H2>Aaron's Bicycle Repair, Inc. does not buy used bikes that folks bring in to us. All of the used bikes we sell have been purchased at garage sales, thrift stores, or donated to us.</H2>
