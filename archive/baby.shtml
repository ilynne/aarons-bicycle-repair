<P>Gypsie started labor at 5:30 AM August 5th, at 2:15 PM  Gypsie was in Transition. The outer membrane water broke at 4:20 PM.
The Labor was really difficult but Gypsie is a STRONG woman.
Unfortunately at midnight we had to transfer to Providence Medical Center because baby was in deep transverse arrest (his head was stuck lengthwise in the pelvis between the ischial  spines). Our Midwife tried every trick in the book to get this baby out naturally.  At 1:44 AM he was born by cesarean by Dr. Ted Palo. The polar opposite of the birth experience we had hoped for, but Braxton is perfect and wonderful and we love him! He is a Leo.</font>
