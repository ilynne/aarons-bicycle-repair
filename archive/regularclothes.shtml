<P><H2>You do not need to wear neon to ride a bike!</H2>
<B><font face="cursive">
<P>We have noticed a huge increase in regular folks just wanting to ride a bike.  They do not want to wear neon, like the powers that be suggest.  We agree that it is not necessary.  Cars will either see you or they won't.  Plus it is a color that looks way out of place off the bike.   Getting more and more folks on bikes is the only thing that will increase our overall safety.  It has been proven over and over again, most recently in Portland, Oregon.  Bikes should be accessable to everyone, easily.   Wear a helmet if you wish.    <A HREF="http://www.momentumplanet.com" >Momentum</A> Magazine promotes this type of biking.
