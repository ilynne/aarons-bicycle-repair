<P><H2>Safe Riding Class</H2>

<P><B>Dear West Seattle Cyclist,

<P align = "justify">Are you tired of riding on bike trails and sidewalks, but lack the skills and
confidence to ride on the streets? Or maybe you are curious about joining the
Cascade Bicycle Club on one of our free daily rides but are intimidated by the
prospects of riding in group? Or maybe you have a good friend who would say yes
to either or both of these two questions?

<P align = "justify">I wanted to let you know about a new fun safe guided riding class, held not in a
classroom or on a closed circuit, but as a fun 10- to 20-mile ride that takes
cyclists from trails to the street. 

<P align = "justify">The first Takin’ it to the Streets! guided safe ride will leave from Jack Block
Park in West Seattle, on Thursday, Aug. 12, at 6:00 p.m. Each class is taught by
a League of American Bicyclists Certified Instructor, who will teach
participants safe riding techniques while they are riding their bike with
traffic. 

<P align = "justify">Takin’ it to the Streets! guided safe riding classes are free, but
pre-registration and a $10 deposit are required to secure your place. The
classes are open to members and non-members of the Cascade Bicycle Club.
