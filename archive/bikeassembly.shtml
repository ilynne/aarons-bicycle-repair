<H2><P>Why buy a <a href="bicycles.shtml" >Bike</A> from Aaron's Bicycle Repair ?</H2>

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so much the brand of bike that is going to make it last but rather it is the way in which it is <i>assembled</i>. A bicycle purchased from us will last longer and work better than the exact same bike purchsed elsewhere! We are not kidding, READ ON.........

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike a VCR or TV, where price and brand may be the deciding factors in a purchase, a bicycle's integrity and durability come from the place purchased. A bicycle comes out of the box only partially assembled by the manufacturer. They arrive in a box about 80% assembled (if you can call it that! really parts are just hung on the bike and my or may not be adjusted). Most shops just finish the job in as little time as possible and often by the lowest skilled/paid employee. We actually dissassemble the bike and reassemble it to our demanding specifications. Examples: The individual components only come with enough  grease for San Diego weather, we put enough in for Seattle  weather!  Wheels bearings come adjusted too tight. Spokes are often too loose. Cables are not stressed (often known as stretched). And cables, pivots and threads are not lubricated. Correcting these things well make your bike trouble-free and last longer!

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bolt and nut (threaded part example: pedal) is lubricated (oil for bolts 5mm and smaller, grease for bolts 6mm and larger) to allow the proper torque to be reached and prevent corrosion. Counterintuitively, lube allows a bolt to be torqued easier and stay tight better than a dry bolt. All the places where your body connects to the bike are of particular importance (stem, bars, seat, pedals, cranks, wheels). We can't even count the number of times a customer has come in with a loose seat bolt. Properly greased, and torqued, a seat bolt will <i>NEVER</i> come loose!

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spoke tension of the factory built wheels is always too loose. We tension each spoke to 200 pounds tension each, then stress relieve the entire wheel. This will make the wheels stay true longer and break fewer spokes We also lubricate each spoke nipple with a special blend of Anti-Seize and Phil Wood Oil to make sure they will always turn.

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We add grease to the wheel (hub), steering (headset) and crank (bottom braket) threads and bearings. We remove the fork and crank, spray the inside of the frame with Boeshield T-9 rustproofing. We grease the inside of the frame at the headset and bottom bracket areas to prevent rust and catch crap (rust or sand) from contaminating the bearings. We replace the lower stack headset bearings with loose balls. This triples the life of the headset and makes the steering smoother.  We also add a bottom braket sleeve if one is missing/needed and  they ususally are!

<p>Below is a list of just a few of the extras things we do to make your bike last and last and last:
<br>Approximate individual shop labor charges in (<font color="red">Red</font>).
<UL>
<LI>True, Tension and Dish the wheels<BR>[They won't come loose] (<font color="red">$40</font>)
<LI>Rustproof Steel Frames: Spray the inside of the frame with Boeshield T-9  (<font color="red">$10</font>)
<LI>Add the proper amount of grease to the wheel bearings (hubs)<BR> [They don't come with enough!] (<font color="red">$35</font>)
<LI>Grease the steer tube [keeps the rust at bay] and add grease to the steering bearing (headset) and replace the lower stack bearing cage with loose balls [triples the life of the headset and makes the steering smoother] (<font color="red">$25</font>)
<LI>Remove and lubricate the crank bearing [bottom bracket] (<font color="red">$25</font>)
<LI>Lubricate the inner cable of the brakes and gears <BR>[Smooth braking and shifting] (<font color="red">$10</font>)
<LI>Align frame and fork Drop-Outs <BR>[Makes bike track straight and prevents bearing failure] (<font color="red">$15</font>)
<LI>All nuts and bolts are torqued to their maximum tightness 
<LI>Lube all threads <BR>[these last 2 steps keep things from loosening up and rusting] (<font color="red">Priceless</font>)
<LI>Add Slime to the tires [prevents 90% of all flats] (<font color="red">$10</font>) <BR>We only do this to high volume tires like mountain or hybrid.
<LI>Free <A HREF ="http://www.greenfieldny.com/chart_bicycle.htm">Greenfield</A> (made in USA) kickstand if wanted (<font color="red">$10</font>)
<LI>Finally, we give the bike a <A HREF ="tuneup.shtml"> Tune-Up</A> (<font color="red">$120</font>)
<LI>This final step involves YOU!
<LI>A bicycle is a machine, and like all machines, there is a "break-in" period. You MUST bring your bike back to the shop for a FREE initial 'Tune-Up' [really a retorquing of all parts and any readjustments needed] after 100-200 miles of riding or 60 days whichever comes <i>last</i>. (<font color="red">$35</font>) Failure to do so can void your warranty! 
</UL>

<P>We also offer this service on bikes purchased at other shops or online.

<BR>On the left is how they look purged before we remove the outboard bearing bearing shields. The shields keep the grease from reaching the inboard bearing. On the right is how they should look. We have contacted <A HREF="http://www.speedplay.com" >Speedplay</A> about this problem, but they do not seem to think it is one!
