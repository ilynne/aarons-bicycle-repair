<P align="Justify">My name is Aaron Goss, I am the owner of Aaron's Bicycle Repair. I am proud of America, but not proud of our government or some of my fellow citizens disregard for other people or the environment. I disagree with President Bush on most issues. War is not the answer and nuclear weapons should be banned from the earth! I am ashamed of the recent corporate greed scandels. My business motto is, "Earth First, People Second, Profit Third".

<p><BR>Some people have accused me of being Anti-American and not supporting the Troops. To them I say this: "Look at yourself if you are offended by someone else's viewpoint". Intolerance is the beginning of fascism (Sadam, Hitler, etc.); tolerating differing opinions is what this country (democracy) is founded on!   The First Amendment is very clear about that. You don't have to agree with someone politically to be friends, business partners, customers, family members or even lovers. I know a few couples that stand on both sides of the isle politcally (and some even religiously). Threatening someone or talking bad about them because of thier viewpoints is a crime.  Regarding supporting the Troops, I pay my taxes! I run a profitable business and create jobs. My tax burden last year was $12,777!  I think that about sums up that issue.The best way we can support our troops is to bring them home, NOW!



<P>I love America. I love the flag's colors. I love what it stands for. I ride a red, white, and blue Cannondale road bike that is made in the USA. You can see it on display at my shop, right in front of Old Glory! I speak my mind. I also listen to others views. I stand for honesty, trust, justice, and truth. I think that would make me about as patriotic as one can get. I may offend some and I am sorry, I don't mean to.  Standing up for what you believe in is hard. Following the crowd is easy.

<P>As far as not supporting the Troops, I can only say this. In my soul I feel that killing another person is wrong. Every religion's true basis says the same thing. Some people have twisted Chrisianity, for example, into saying that sometimes killing is OK. Jesus would not agree! How great of a species would we be if we could solve our problems peacefully? How much safer would the world be?

<P>I was born on September 11, 1966.
<p align="Justify">I have heard or read my birth date every single day since 9/11/2001.
<BR>I have also thought about the horrific events everyday since then. I feel I have a special, valuable viewpoint not shared by the general public. Some people in the world hate the U.S. We must figure out why and change our actions. They do not hate us because we value freedom. Perhaps they hate us because of our governments killing of their people? Or because we are consumer pigs? We have so much good to offer the world, let's not let our greed and petty ways blind us. We have to start sharing this planet's wealth with the rest of its inhabitants (both human and not).

<P><B>Oh, and what the heck is this? If you buy this shirt you are NOT a patriot!  It matters where things are made.  I am not saying don't buy anything from China, just not crap you don't need.  Little plastic cute toys and trinkets, cheap housewares, cheap clothing, etc.  Buy quality that lasts.  It will cost you less in the long run and be better for the planet.
