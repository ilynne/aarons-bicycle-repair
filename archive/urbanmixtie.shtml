<P><B>Here at ABR we have a different idea about what makes a good city bike.  Once you examine the details, we think you will agree.
<BR>The bicycle industry (and most other shops) are driven by slick marketing and what ever is trendy, cool or racey.  Disc brakes and carbon fiber race bikes for example.

<P>The features of a good modern city bike are comfort, utility and durability.  
<BR>Specifically: Handlebars that give an upright position, Hub Brakes, Kickstand, Fenders, Lighting System, Bell, Flat Pedals, Luggage Rack, Gears for the terrain.

<P>Some notable differences between our design and the industry's:

<BR>Horizontal drop-outs make that possible. This bike would be very nice with a <a hfref="http://www.rohloff.de">Rohloff</A> hub.

<P>Our typical mountain bike to city conversion.  <BR>We have been doing <a href="upconvert.shtml">Upright Conversions</A> for years. You will love riding a bike again!<BR>Go find yourself a <a href="usedbikes.shtml">used bike</A> and bring it in.  For between $500 and $600 we can convert into the bike you see below. 
<BR>Changes include City Handlebars, Street Tires, Fenders, Flat Pedals and Kickstand. 
<BR>A Basket and Nicer Seat (we recommend Brooks) also make it more comfortable and useful.
