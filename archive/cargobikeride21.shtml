<P>This 4th of July will be the fourth annual Independence Day cargo bike ride
& picnic.  Come ride with us to celebrate your independence from motor
vehicles and expensive gasoline.  All kinds of bikes and bikers are
welcome.  Expect to see lots of <A HREF="http://www.xtracycle.com" >Xtracycles</A>, trailers, customized racks, 
baskets, and more!
 
<P>We will meet at the Pergola at First and Yesler in Pioneer Square at noon
and leave at 12:30.  The destination is <A HREF="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=rxswmg4t3q9x&style=o&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=11077325&encType=1">Terminal 107</A>, a very pleasant park hidden among the industry along the Duwamish waterway.  We'll take a tour
of the bike path that follows the new light rail tracks, then head west
across the West Seattle Bridge, then south along West Marginal Way where
another short trail will take us to the park.  It's a pretty short ride!
