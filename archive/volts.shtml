<P>Volts (V), Amperes (A) and Watts (W) are all units of electricity.
<P>V = W / A
<P>A = W / V
<P>W = V x A
<P>Everyone knows how bright a 100 watt light bulb looks. However, watts aren't a good way to tell the brightness of a light source.  Most street lights are 100 watts for example.
<BR>Bulb quality, material, the inert gasses inside the bulb (Krypton or Halogen), reflector and lenses all contribute to light output. The units <i>Lumen</i>, <i>Lux</i> and  <i>Foot-Candle</i> are used to determine actual brightness.  You could purchase a Lux Meter or just come into our shop and try out the lights in person. Many of the new LED lights are amazingly bright.
<BR>It is our opinion that many bike lights are TOO BRIGHT!  Especially for trail use, where bikes come at you head-on.
<BR>Our staff commutes by bike all year long, so we have first-hand experience of what works.
