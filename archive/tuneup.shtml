<P>What is a Tune-Up?
<BR>Simply put it is a service that brings your bike back to new condition.
<BR>The 5 main steps are:

<P>Every bike can benefit from our Ultimate Tune-Up. Why? 
<BR>Because good mechanics are few and far between. And bicycles are often not properly adjusted from the start when they were new.
<BR>Well ridden or very old bikes will benefit from a <A HREF= "overhaul.shtml">Complete Overhaul</A>

<P>What if I just want a Basic Tune-Up?
</B><BR><FONT SIZE = -1>Many shops offer what they call Performance, Quick, Basic, Standard, The Chicken, Minor, etc. Tune-Ups.
<BR>We feel there really is only one reason to Tune-Up a bicycle.  That reason is to bring it back to like-new mechanical condition.  Our Ultimate Tune-Up is so thorough that we actually correct mistakes made during the inital assembly of your bike. We often improve the bike's workings.  We use superior replacement parts like brake pads, cables, housings, ferrules and lubricants. If you do not want to spend $120 on your bike, bring it by and we can assess what your bike needs most urgently. We will give you honest advice.  Our goal is that you ride your bike, not to drain your bank account!  We offer what we call a Triage where we go over your bike, inspect for safety, do our 10 point check, lubricate what needs to be, clean it superficially and make adjustments here and there.   Cost is from $20 to $50.  Much less than other shop's Mini-Tunes and it will keep you on the road until you get a proper Tune-Up.

<font color=green><P>Do I need an appointment?   <i>MAYBE</i>........ Bring it in!  
<BR>Depending on our current work load & storage capacity, we will either fix it while you wait,  keep your bike or schedule an appointment.  Check-ins can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. If we are really busy, please be patient. We usually do <font color="black"><i>repairs</i></font> while you wait and make appointments for <font color="black"><i>maintenance</i></font>.  Either way, we need to see your bike first so we can check it over and make sure we will have the parts in stock when it comes time to service it.  It is not possible to give you an estimate without seeing it since bicycle conditions and components vary wildly. We do not give phone estimates, however, all our <A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tzv4oaGqsUAWBIOnwYdMEsQ&output=html" >labor rates</A> are posted on our website.
</font>
<P>There is NEVER a need for an appointment for a repair to keep your bike rolling.
<BR>Examples:  Brake Pad Replacement, Wheel Truing and Spoke Replacement, Gear Adjustments and of course FLAT TIRES!
