<P><B><font color="#008080" size="4">&#147;I pledge to begin taking as
many of the following steps as I can to stave off the worst effects of global
warming, and spread the word. In so doing I will cut fossil fuel use. I
will do some or all of the following:</font></B></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cut down on driving my vehicle, or carpool. I will walk or bike,
and not buy a car if I do not have one (best of all). I will support and
use mass transit. I may work closer to my home.</b></font></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cut down on working just for money: I can thereby barter more, and
cut down on commuting.</b></font></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">3.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Depave my driveway, or help others&#146; depave their driveways,
or depave parking lots, and grow food in depaved land.</b></font></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">4.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unplug or retire my television, and perhaps go off the electricity
grid. I will reduce energy for heating, and share appliances such as my
oven with neighbors, and not buy or use power tools or jet skis, etc.</b></font></P>

  <p><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Publicly oppose new road construction and road widening in my community,
to start undoing sprawl, prevent growth in traffic, and halt the spread
of forest roads allowing clearcuts.</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Take vacations without jet air travel, and avoid career activity
dependent on jet travel.</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">7.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Plant trees, collect rainwater, and avoid overusing municipal water
as it is energy-consumptive (and thus may emit CO2, the main heat-trapping
gas that fossil fuels release).</b></font></p>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">8.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Buy local products, buy as little plastic as possible, carry a travel
mug. Minimize consumption. Support alternative plant materials to cut down
on petrochemicals and trees for paper. Avoid eating animal products especially
shipped-in beef.</b></font></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">9.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not bring more children into the world, or limit my offspring to
one, and possibly adopt. I recognize the threat of overpopulation.</b></font></P>

<P><font size="2"><b><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">10.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Inform my community and the greater national and global community
on the need to take action such as the above for climate stability.&#148;</b></font></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><font color="#008080" size="4">Ten detailed steps for greenhouse relief
and benefits</font></B></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">1. Drive your car less, or give it up.</span></B> Perhaps you can
try carpooling or renting a car. Eventually you could move your residence
closer to work, or find a job closer to home. Ride a bike, walk, take the
bus or the train. Use bike-carts for hauling. Each gallon of gasoline burned
means five pounds of carbon into the atmosphere. The U.S. burns over 115
billion gallons a year.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">2. Cut down on working just for cash.</span></B> Personal arrangements
reduce commuting and boost community. Garden or farm locally so you can
share in the food. Help clean or repair someone&#146;s home, and in return
perhaps get your hair styled or get a massage! Do some child care or teaching
in your immediate neighborhood so others don&#146;t have to drive their
kids, and you may be compensated in the form of getting some clothing, firewood
or music lessons. Establish local currency.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">3. Depave your driveway</span></B> or someone else&#146;s. <B>Grow
food. </B>Tear up a parking lot. Good soil for growing food is often under
asphalt and concrete, except when a bed of rocks was put in and soil scraped
away. Narrowing a road (which calms traffic and lowers the &#147;urban heat
island effect&#148; of pavement) can allow for all-important tree planting.
Create compost with kitchen scraps and garden clippings, for growing depaved
veggies. Save urine for fertilizing trees; dilute it for garden plants.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">4. Unplug the television</span></B> and other electric or motorized
appliances or toys. Read books, play non-electric musical instruments, and
talk with your family. Get news and entertainment from a solar or handcrank
radio. <B>Get off the grid:</B> use no electricity in first one room, then
others. Reduce heating. Share ovens: Six loaves of bread can bake at once
instead of one-this means getting together with neighbors! Go to bed early
so as to not turn night into day. Use non-petroleum oil lamps. Minimize
outdoor lighting. No motorized recreational toys or two-stroke engines.
Push-mow lawns; bring back the scythe to clear fields.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">5. Halt road construction</span></B> at local, state and national
levels. More roads and wider roads bring about more car and truck traffic
and CO2 emissions, and allow sprawl development which means more electricity-demand
and less green space. Roads are the way forests have been clearcut. There
should be no compromise: our biosphere is running out of time. Cheap oil
is running out too fast for myriad roads to be useful.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">6. Reject the jet:</span></B> Take vacations without air travel. Sail.
Go into a line of work not requiring jet travel. Jets are less energy efficient
than cars, per capita, comparing a jet full of passengers to one person
driving. Forget jet skis too!</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">7. Plant trees on lawns (including golf courses), and everywhere:
they suck up CO2.</span></B> Vital places for restoration include stream
and river banks, and dirt roads that have been closed. (Do close roads;
the Earth would approve.) Hope that increasingly violent storms due to global
warming will not destroy forests and plants too badly. Collect rain water
and use water sparingly for washing, especially cars, as pumping municipal
water can use much fossil-fuel energy that adds to global warming.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">8. Buy and consume locally:</span> </B>This cuts down on petroleum-based
transport. Also, <B>buy smart: little or no petroleum plastic. </B>Reuse
paper bags and glass containers. Support sustainable, nontoxic materials-industries
such as hemp: it replaces pulping of trees. Buy in bulk. Reuse and recycle
everything including kitchen scraps for compost.&nbsp; Avoid eating animal
products especially shipped-in beef<b>.</b>&nbsp; Consume no factory-farm
animal products; the herds create methane and demand great quantities of
electricity and petroleum. Earth&#146;s petroleum&#151;oil and natural gas&#151;will
be virtually gone before 2050. Growing food organically does not use fertilizers
made from natural gas or pesticides from oil.&nbsp; To improve diet for health
and localization, look into www.living-foods.com.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">9. Reduce population growth:</span> </B>Adopt a child instead of reproducing,
but bearing one child is better than adding two to the population. Fewer
consumers especially in the highest per capita energy-using nation (the
U.S.) means lower global-warming emissions. Why bring another life into
an overpopulated, greenhouse world? Instead of &#147;More Jobs&#148; for
more people, what about less people? More &#147;jobs&#148;=more CO2 emissions.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">10. Community action: Aim it toward governments and big corporations.</span></B>
If today&#146;s level of outcry against genetically engineered food and
the excesses of world corporate trade were combined, that might be enough
to get the ball rolling. So, write letters, demonstrate in the streets,
form boycotts, and attend city-council and county-supervisor hearings. Use
the Internet to email this, and link websites to <a href="http://www.culturechange.org">www.culturechange.org</a>. Take
loving action to discourage fellow citizens&#146; climate-changing habits.
Good luck to us all; we are all one.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><i>by Jan Lundberg</i></font></P>

<P><font size="2">Our world is wondrous and still is mysterious. May it always contain
and nurture development of species, and rocks too, in all their amazing
variety and function, as vital to the whole. Simply because civilization
recently came along and allowed overpopulation of one confused species (most
of us by now), does not mean we should give up hope for resuming our evolution
in an accepting, joyful fashion.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">As daunting as today&#146;s problems are&#151;that we have foisted on
the future as well&#151;we are fortunate to be here and alive. In our time
on the Earth we need to love one another and our common home, for our own
happiness and peace of mind, as well as for securing for the future the
beauty of this little third stone from the Sun. Our achievements can be
said to be awesome, but perhaps the best of them return our attention to
the original state of abundance shared by all: &#147;Please don&#146;t destroy
these lands/Don&#146;t make them desert sands.&#148; (the Yardbirds, mid
1960s)</font></P>

<P><B><font size="4">What you may have already known:</font><font size="2"><br>
</font></B><font size="2">Greenhouse gases are building up due to human activity. The result is
a measurable rise in average global temperature of one degree Fahrenheit
from one hundred years ago. That is amazing in geohistory, and the trend
is accelerating. The hottest seven years since record keeping began have
been in the 1990s. The resultant distortion of the planet&#146;s sensitive
climate system is now bringing on sea-level rise and new patterns of drought,
affecting crops and fisheries. More intense storms are part of rapid global
warming; this phase has begun. Four-fifths of the main greenhouse gas, carbon
dioxide, is from fossil fuels combustion. Meanwhile, industry propagandists
(fossil-fuel lobbyists and corporate news-media commentators) spin myths
that more carbon is good for plant growth, and that there is scientific
debate on global warming. The grains of truth in those concepts are more
than offset by the reality of deforestation and loss of fertile soils that
are drying and eroding as never before. Desertification has accelerated,
but is nothing new as a by-product of civilization.</font></P>

<P><B><font size="4">What you may NOT have known:</font><font size="2"><br>
</font></B><font size="2">Current climate change from global warming is happening more rapidly
than expected by scientists and their computer climate-change models, because
<B><I>the models do not incorporate the effects of humans&#146; actions
such as deforesting the Amazon rainforest.</I></B> Climatologists warn that
if the Earth loses much more precipitation-regulating forests, then warming
and droughts could rapidly intensify. Ice caps are melting, most glaciers
are in retreat, and huge chunks of Antarctic ice shelves are breaking off,
promising to boost ocean temperature and sea-level rise several times more
than the models forecast. The U.S. had its warmest spring on record this
year, which followed the warmest winter on record. The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said this year the climate is warming
at &#147;an unprecedented rate.&#148; If cooling sulphur emissions and aerosols&#151;which
may cease in production, and do not linger long in the atmosphere&#151;are
taken into account, global warming is<I> significantly greater</I> than
calculated.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">What we are putting into the atmosphere today will not be felt or detected
in terms of global warming for another 50 years or more. The discernible
<B><I>warming today due to fossil fuel burning comes from prior to 1950</I></B>.
Not to slow global warming now is madness.</font></P>

<P><font size="2"><B>Positive feedback loops</B> mean that carbon or methane &#147;sinks&#148;
become greenhouse gas sources (emitters), and rising temperatures cause
more release of the gases, causing quicker global warming which releases
more gases more quickly, and so on&#151;<B>the runaway greenhouse effect</B>.
The Arctic&#146;s permafrost is melting, releasing CO2 and methane contained
there; ocean temperatures are rising which kills phytoplankton that soak
up carbon; ocean water expands when heated and would engulf more land, killing
vegetation that releases CO2. Meanwhile, bodies of water hold heat while
ice reflects it away. Vast amounts of frozen methane on sea bottoms can
be released, contributing to oceanic and atmospheric warming. Species are
being driven extinct at a rate of perhaps over one hundred a day, before
much global warming has even hit.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Individual and mass action is clearly required now; we must not wait
to see what Al Gore would do. He supports more highway building, which increases
motor vehicle use. <B>U.S. automobiles are the single biggest contributor
to greenhouse-gas emissions</B>. If non-petroleum fuels were the new propulsion
for vehicles, the amount of CO2 emissions would<I> increase</I> with electric
vehicles charged up on a fossil-fuel electric utility grid. But most emissions
from cars are from the mining and manufacturing of the cars and components.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">The Kyoto Protocol, a United Nations-spawned proposed treaty adopted
in 1997, calls for the U.S. to cut greenhouse gases by 7% of 1990 levels.
The Senate has not yet ratified it. Meanwhile, emissions have risen, to
over 11% beyond 1990 levels. So, emissions are supposed to go down by 18%
between 2008-2012, assuming they stopped going up now. The revised goal
for arithmetic accuracy by then may have to be 25%, although that is less
than half of what the climate needs&#151;assuming other nations came through
too. Unless this happens, the result may be the runaway greenhouse effect.
Scientists with the U.N.&#146;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
stated in 1995 that the world&#146;s fossil-fuels emissions reduction must
be 60-80%. In Kyoto, Fossil Fuels Policy Action was advised that <B>transport
is the sector accounting for the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the
1990s</B>. To offset this means no new roads globally. It means retiring
cars as Cuba did upon losing its Soviet oil. It means massive birth control.
It means neighbors sharing the use of ovens to cook meals, and more.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">In June 2000 the <i> San Francisco</i> <I>Chronicle</I> referred to the &#147;Global
Warming Debate&#148; in a headline. This adds to confusion and prevents
needed action. The reality of climate-change is not getting through, despite
the alternative media. The U.S. government demands cheaper gasoline from
the oil companies and more oil from OPEC. With that kind of leadership,
when it knows full well what global warming is doing, our choosing lifestyle
change on the individual level is what the Earth demands. In the process
of a mass movement we will save money and improve health and sociability.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Due to heatwaves at present, perhaps due to global warming, energy shortages
exist for electric power. This seems like the best reason and time to implement
Kyoto-type cuts in consumption to cut emissions.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">The &#147;technofix&#148; hope, pinned on renewable energy, can be a
misleading dead-end when we consider dwindling oil&#146;s unique applications,
and we face existing overpopulation propped up by cheap petroleum. The technofix
is well supported in the environmental movement&#146;s literature because
the industrial approach gets well funded. The inefficient, overbuilt infrastructure
that the technofix would attempt to preserve relies on oil&#146;s non-energy
uses: e.g., asphalt, tires and plastic.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">This document&#146;s list of steps to take is limited. Be creative! Eventually,
a natural balance can be restored, and we will along the way achieve local
food-supply security through non-petroleum farming and non-oil transport
and trade. The steps in the Pledge for Climate Stabilization would aid the
grassroots movement to fight climate destabilization.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">Legislation and court decisions limiting secondhand smoke was possible
through active respect for individual and public health. To pass and enforce
laws against motor-vehicle exhaust is harder than fighting tobacco companies,
because the national and global economy would collapse without ongoing sales
of new motor vehicles. Some would welcome collapse, but society is already
challenged to adequately care for stockpiles of nuclear weapons and radioactive
waste.</font></P>

<P><font size="2">There is hope in grassroots, nonviolent direct action. It is peaceful
when people in the opposition&#151;those in denial&#151;are thought of as
lacking information or in experience in using courage. Shutting down the
WTO meeting peacefully in Seattle last fall proves people can be motivated
to turn off the televisions and computers, get out of their cars, and make
a long-term difference.</font>
