<P align=justify>Urban Cafe Assault Team (UCAT of Seattle), <i>Breakfast With Good Company</i>, started in the spring of 1994 as an attempt to get two friends together for a blind date. We figured a group of common friends having breakfast together would be a comfortable atmosphere for the two to meet. As it turned out, one of them did not show up! Everyone else ended up having such a good time, we all decided to do it again. We called ourselves The Breakfast Club then. One of our members created the logo and we started sending out postcards every month.

<P>RULES:
<P>Please invite your friends, new people are always welcome!
<br>When paying, include a 20% tip  (no Breakfast Weasels!) 
<BR>Have Fun!

<P align=justify>If you have an idea for a place to meet, email us. The group is usually 15-25 people. One time we had 30!  Keep that in mind for suggesting restaurants. We like to get one giant table.
