<P>Dress up if you like, but casual is also fine.  Wear what ever you feel like, we really don't care!  Let's just have some fun!
<br>We go to parks, restaruants, pubs or private homes for community and dinner.  We play it by ear.  Our route is always less than 10 miles and a slow, social pace.  We wave at walkers and we sometimes ride on the sidewalk. If you need a bike, ABR can loan you one.  We also have spare lights.
<BR>Let's show everyone that you do not need a car to go out on the town.   

<P>There is a growing groundswell of folks just like you that DO NOT want to wear neon green to ride a bike.  Many do not even want to wear helmets!<BR>They just want to go someplace without getitng in a car or taking the bus.  Going on their own time, on their own route. This ride celebrates that.  You do not need a car to LIVE!
