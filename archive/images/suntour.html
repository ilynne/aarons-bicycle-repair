<H3>SunTour Bicycle Parts</H3>
<P><B>It wasn't long ago when you were looking for value and
quality in bicycle parts the name SunTour was the brand of choice. SunTour
invented the modern derailleur design and the compact drivetrain (Micro
Drive). Unfortunately about 7 years ago, SunTour USA closed its doors and
the parent company in Japan was sold to some folks in Taiwan. The remaining
inventory in Japan was sold to J&amp;B Importers (a wholesale company based
in Miami) and sold off at crazy low prices.

<P><BR>Smart shops stocked up on the key replacement parts,
like shifters, gears and rear derailleurs, because in order for old SunTour
shifting to work properly, all the parts must match. Most of the supply
of old parts has run out. If you need a replacement part for a SunTour
bike over 5 or 6 years old you will have to shop around. Swap meets are
still good places to find parts.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1 color="red">Good News!</FONT> Aaron's Bicycle Repair has located a supply of original SunTour parts. We have access to Cranks,
Front and Rear Derailleurs, Cassettes, Freewheels, Shifters and more. The
stock goes back over 15 years but is limited. Call the shop for availability
at (206) 938-9795 ask for Aaron. We only sell person-to-person<font color="red"> (No mail order or Internet sales!)</font>, BUT..... we can give you the names of some suppliers that your local dealer can order from for you. Support your local bike shop!

<P>Even though most bike shops HATE mail order because of their cut-throat practices, there is one mail order outfit that all right:

<P>They have some cool retro SunTour stuff. I highly reccomend The Rivendell Reader. Issue #14 has a whole bike load of SunTour history and facts!

<P><H3>SunTour Reborn:</H3> The New SunTour
is alive and well. They make excellent replacement cranks, gears and derailleurs
that are 100% Shimano compatible. However the new parts will <U>not</U>
