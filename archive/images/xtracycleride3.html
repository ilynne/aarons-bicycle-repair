<P><H3>Novmeber 25<sup>th</sup>, 2005 at 10 AM [aka <A HREF="http://www.adbusters.org/metas/eco/bnd" target=right>Buy Nothing Day</A>]</H3>   

<P align="justify">Meet at <A HREF="http://www.allcitycoffee.com" target=right>All City Coffee</A> in Georgetown.   

<P>Now how in the heck do we not buy anything?  First of all the main thing to 'protest' is the use of gasoline and cars and by riding bikes we automatically do that. However, this is not a protest ride, just a fun ride.  We will be leading by example that one can have fun without cars and trucks but the main focus here is fun and enjoying the bicycle.  So if we buy something (like coffee) so be it.  

<P>That said, Let's all bring our own coffee!  Bring your camp stove, your hand held coffee grinders, your coffee pots, your French presses, your tea kettles, etc.  No one will cry fowl if you buy coffee at anyone of Seattle's thousand coffee cafe's.

<P>Here is our planned route:  <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/c4v5l" target=right>http://tinyurl.com/c4v5l</A>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Only 13 miles

<P align="justify"><b>If you don't know what an Xtracycle is then click <A HREF="xtracycle.html" target=right>here</A> or go to <A HREF="http://www.xtracycle.com" target=right>Xtracycle.com</A> This ride is not just for Xtracyclers. All bikers, cyclists, riders and passengers are invited! This ride is all about the usefullness of the bicycle.  Cargo hauling is THE key feature of the Xtracycle and since it is still a bicycle it is very fun to ride! 


<P>Please help spread the word about this ride!
