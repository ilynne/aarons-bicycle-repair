<P><b><FONT SIZE = +2 COLOR = RED>THIS IS THE VAL KLEITZ MEMORIAL RIDE!</FONT>

<P><H3>MEET AT NOON, LEAVE AT 1 O'CLOCK</H3> 


<P>Start at <A HREF ="http://www.2020cycle.com">20/20 Cycle</A>, 2020 East Union on Capitol Hill.
<P>End at <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/PARKS/park_detail.asp?id=483">Cowen/Ravenna Park</A>.
We are going down the trail to the big shelter in the middle of the park (<A href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=seattle&sll=37.09024,-95.712891&sspn=48.688845,78.75&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Seattle,+King,+Washington&ll=47.671485,-122.305346&spn=0.002547,0.00685&t=h&z=18">Map</A>) for a BBQ picnic.  It usually takes an hour to an hour and a half to get to the park.  Cargo rides go slow!  Plan on being at the park from 2-ish to 5 or 6 pm.  Then it is off (on your own) to the wake at the Pike Brewery.

<P>Cargo hauling is fun especially if you or your kids ARE cargo!  Bring kids!
