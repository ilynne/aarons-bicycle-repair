<P>Meet near the Pike Place Pig and ride to <A Href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=460" target = right>Lincoln Park</A> in West Seattle, a totally flat ride! (Well, almost flat, just some very tiny short easy hills like the lower West Seattle Bridge). 
<P>This is a stick-together ride and there will be refueling/supply stops at 7-11 along Harbor Avenue and Alki Beach <A Href="http://goo.gl/maps/ODrIa">Here is the route</A>.

<P>We should arrive at one of the south beach shelters or picnic tables sometime around 3-ish.  Look for all the bikes! 

<P>ALL BIKES WELCOME not just <A HREF="xtracycle.shtml">Xtracycles</A>, Trailers, Front Racks, Rear Racks, Panniers, <A HREF="http://www.dutchbikeseattle.com" >Bakfiets</A>, Porter Bikes, Messenger Bags, etc., etc.

<P>Watch the video below to get a sense of what a cargo bike ride is like:
