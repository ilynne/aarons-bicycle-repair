<P Align=justify><B>Max grew up on Vashon Island and started mountain biking a lot in high school and eventully got into BMX and fixed gears.  He loves working on bikes and is learning a lot at ABR.  Max lives in West Seattle now and loves how much street there is to ride in Seattle.  On weekends he's probably gapping over something to flat on his BMX bike or playing guitar and screaming in his band Hit by A Car.
