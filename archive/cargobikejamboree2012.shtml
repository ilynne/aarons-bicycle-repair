<P>Meet near the Pike Place Pig and ride to <A Href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=460" target = right>Lincoln Park</A> in West Seattle, a totally flat ride! (Well, almost flat, just some very tiny short easy hills like the lower West Seattle Bridge). 
<P>This is a stick-together ride and there will be one refueling/supplies stop at 7-11 along Harbor Avenue for supplies and ice for the bike blended smoothies! This is our <A Href="http://tinyurl.com/3mbe23v">approximate route</A>
, but subject to the group's whim.

<P>If you want to meet us there, we will be somewhere along the south beach sometime around 3 PM.  Look for a bunch of bikers with smiles!

<P>ALL BIKES WELCOME not just <A HREF="xtracycle.shtml">Xtracycles</A>, Trailers, Front Racks, Rear Racks, Panniers, <A HREF="http://www.dutchbikeseattle.com" >Bakfiets</A>, Porter Bikes, Messenger Bags, etc., etc.

<P>Cargo hauling is fun especially if you are cargo!
<BR>Speaking of cargo, please note, we pack out all recyclables!
