<P align="justify">What is a Bikestation? 
<BR>Basically it is a bicycle parking garage. Bikestation Seattle is a large double decker bike rack located inside of a bike shop. The garage part is open 24/7 to members. It offers secure, safe and <i>dry</i> bicycle parking for everyone during shop business hours. The shop offers parts and accessories, repair, bike rental, and rain gear.  Bikestation Seattle is located in Pioneer Square in the historic <A Href="http://www.samis.com/Main_office.shtml#Mottman" >Mottman Building</A>, 311 3rd AVE South (the space on the left, located just north of the <A Href="http://www.seametropolicemuseum.org" >Seattle Police Museum</A>). Also Metro's lost and found bicycles (bikes left on a Metro bus) can be picked up there. 

 
<P align="justify">As a <u>clean mobility center</u> Bikestation will also offer information on <A Href="http://www.flexcar.com" >Flexcar</A>, <A Href="http://transit.metrokc.gov" >Metro Buses</A>, Ridesharing/Carpooling, bike maps and everything else related to getting around without a single occupant vehicle.
