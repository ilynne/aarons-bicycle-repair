<P><h2>Frame Mounted Basket Bike</H2>
<P align = "justify"><B>With the help of <A href="http://www.haulincolin.com" >Haulin' Colin</A> we built this bike.  Colin will do this for any steel framed bike. Cost is around $200 plus the basket, paint job extra.  The <A href="http://www.waldsports.com" >Wald</A> Giant Delivery is the recommended choice for the basket. 
<br>Many city bikes these days come with a front basket.  Several companies are even making large platforms or racks for larger loads.
<BR>Heavy loads when loaded on the fork affect the steering and these bikes will just fall down with a regular kickstand.  They need a centerstand and a steering stablizer (or lock) like the <A href="http://www.hebie.de" >Hebie</A> made spring type. Mounting the basket to the frame solves these problems.  Just like the old <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cricketcam2000/2565713401" >Schwinn Cycletruck</A>.  The only difference is Colin is adapting existing used bike stock  As cargo needs become greater, more companies will start making smart cargo bikes again.  A 20" front wheel is smarter and a steeper head angle and smaller wheel give lower trail, which makes the bike handle better at low speed with a heavy load.   <A href="http://www.bilenky.com" >Bilenky</A> makes a similar bike.

<P>Here is a replica of Val's famous Dreadnought</A>. We call this the Dreadnought 2
<BR>The frame was repaired and basket installed by <A href="http://www.haulincolin.com" >Haulin' Colin</A>.  The Xtracycle was re-inforced by <A href="valsbio.shtml" >Val Kleitz</A>  and the whole thing was painted by <A href="http://www.seattlepowdercoat.com" >Seattle Powdercoat</A>.
