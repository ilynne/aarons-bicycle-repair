<P align="justify">We rode from the shop to <A Href="images/alkibeach.jpg" >Alki Beach</A>, around Duwamish Head and back  (about 11 miles).  We stopped for a pic-nic/potluck on the beach.  In the spirit of no waste, everyone brought his/her own reuseable, plate, cup and eating utensils.  We packed out our recycling too.  We only had 1 small bag of trash!


<P align="justify">This ride was not just for Xtracyclers. All bikers, cyclists, riders and passengers were invited!  We had 2 kid passengers!This ride was all about the usefullness of the bicycle.  Cargo hauling is THE key feature of the Xtracycle and since it is still a bicycle it is very fun to ride!
