<P align="justify">Some of the best single track around is just 5 miles from West Seattle! It only takes about 45 minutes to get there by bike, and that includes the ferry ride!
<br>Come join us for offroad rides most Sundays  to Vashon Island. Meet at the shop at 11:30 AM and ride to the  <A HREF="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?departingterm=9&arrivingterm=22&roundtrip=true" >ferry</A>  at the Fauntleroy Dock. We shoot for catching the 11:40 AM or 12:20 PM boat. There is a quick offroad ride thru Lincoln Park on the way to the ferry. The total distance is usually 20 - 25 miles of  easy to moderate pace and we stop to regroup at intersections. We are doing this for fun! If you would like to try it on your own see below for a map or <A HREF="http://www.dirtworld.com/trails/trail.asp?id=252">DirtWorld.com</A> or  <A HREF="http://evergreenmtb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Trail:Island_Center_Forest_(Vashon_DNR)">Evergreen Mountian Bike Alliance</A> for a trail description.
