<P>We are a service center for <A href="http://www.rohloff.de" >Rohloff</A> hubs and stock all parts and bulk Rohloff cleaning and lubricating oil.

<P>Rohloff hubs need an oil change every 3000 miles.  We recommend a thorough cleaning in kerosene every 2 or 3 oil changes.
<BR>Service needs really depends on many factors including but not limited to: rider weight, terrain, weather, frequency of use & milage.

<P>If you have a Transfer Box, it should be opened and re-lubricated during the kerosene cleaning.  We re-pack the gears with water proof marine grease (aka boat trailer wheel bearing grease).  In Seattle, we have seen the exposed bearing and gears rust out.

<P>We can drill your Rohloff hubshell for 48 spokes.  (please note this will void your warranty, but a new hubshell is only around $200 if it should ever crack.  However, the only Rohloffs that we have ever heard of cracking, were  on tandems.   32 spokes may be strong enough, but the durablility is just not there for heavy loads.   The guts of the hub, however, are plenty strong!)
