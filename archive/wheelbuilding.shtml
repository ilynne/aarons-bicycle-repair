<p align="justify">What is a custom wheel? Simply put it is any wheel built by an experienced mechanic in a shop setting. Contrary bicycle magazine reviews, the best wheels are still built one at a time at your local bike shop. Nothing can come close! Sure the fancy wheels from Shimano, Rolf, Cane Creek and others are light and responsive. However, the thing they neglect to tell you is those wheels are made for RACE ONLY conditions. They do not hold up to daily use! Our roads in Seattle are far from perfect and you will only have problems with a complete wheel from a major brand.  When one spoke on a 16 spoke rear wheel breaks, you will be walking home.
<P>Let us build a wheel for you and your particular needs and you will NEVER have any problems with it!! Guarantteed! We back this up with FREE TRUING FOREVER. Come by and we will help you decide on the very best wheel for your needs. Our only stipulation for the warranty is that you buy the rim and spokes from us.

<P>We will also build with <i>almost</i> any component you choose, but may not stand behind the durability of the wheel.  
<BR>We will NOT build a wheel with a carbon rim.  
<BR>We will also build on your hub. (Warranty included)
<BR>We will also build with your rim and hub.  (No warranty)
<BR>In certainn cases a rim can be reused, but spokes almost never.
<BR>WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THE USE OF ALLOY NIPPLES.  We will only use them for racing wheels. The weight savings is not worth the disadvantage in durability!

<P>Many people ask us about MAVIC rims. We do not sell them because we have seen too many MAVIC rims crack prematurely.  The extrusion is too thin and the aluminum too brittle.

<P><B>A WORD ABOUT FANCY PREBUILT WHEELSETS:
<p Align=justify>Unfortunately, many companies are now touting the virtues of speed, aerodynamics and light weight in their fancy wheel sets. Some brands are Rolf, Cane Creek, Spinergy, Mavic, Shimano and others. If you read the fine print in the manuals that come with these wheels they will say they are a lightweight, high performance wheel set not designed for constant use. Basically they are saying these wheels are Race Only! Contrary to popular opinion, racing is not that hard on equipment. Commuting or hard off-road riding is much harder on parts. Unlike racing, the conditions are less controlled and the bike sees many more miles. Consequently, these wheels hold up better under racing conditions and should not be used for training or everyday use. Get a pair of handbuilt 32 or 36 spoke count standard wire wheels and you will have far fewer problems. Maintenance is also cheaper on standard spoked wheels.

<P><b>Problems/Disadvantages we have seen with these wheels:
<UL>
<li>Expensive, hard to replace spokes
<li>Inferior or undersized bearings
<li>1 to 2 week down time for repairs because most parts will need to be special ordered
<li>Cheap freehweel mechanism and/or poor seals
<li>High prices
<li>Too few spokes
<li>Won't hold true
<li>Premature spoke failure
</ul>

<P>Some light weight people (under 165 pounds) or those with lots of finesse have success with these wheels but the rest of us should shy away from them. If you already have a set, keep it for special days or racing and have us build you a durable set you will never have problems with. Guaranteed!

<P>Our <A Href="http://www.philwood.com" >Phil Wood</A> spoke cutting/threading machine can cut any color, size, type or material of spoke.
<BR>We can even re-cut old zinc plated spokes for period correct restorations!
<BR>We stock blank quality stainless straight gauge and double butted spokes from Phil Wood, Sapim and DT. All spokes come with DT nipples.
<P>We can accuratly measure and calculate spoke length for your rim and hub.  Bring them to us for in-person measurements.  Published dimentions are often wrong due to manufacturing tolerances and die wear.  If we measure your hub and rim, then we guarantee the spoke length will be correct!

<P>We can build you any fun/cool lacing pattern you like. 
<BR>Crow's foot, for example, is a strong way to save a little weight, it is also a great conversation piece at the pre-ride coffee / post-ride beer!

<P>Below is another 16 x 1/38" (349mm) wheel we built for a Brompton.  The customer had purchased the hub, only available in 36 holes, online but the rims are only available in 28 and 32 holes.  His wheel has 32 spokes.
<P><IMG SRC="images/wheels/brompton36hub32rim.jpg">



<P>Many other factors contribute to wheel durability such as: road conditions, grades ridden, tire size, tire pressure, rider finesse, cargo weight, rim profile, wheel diameter, etc.
<BR>When deciding on a new wheel, it is best for your mechanic to see your bike as well.  There are many variables to consider, especially with rear wheels. That way we can best help you choose the best wheel for you.
