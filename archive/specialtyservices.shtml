<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many modern bicycles have such varied and unique equipment, it can be daunting for a shop to keep up to date with repair tools and procedures. Here at Aaron's Bicycle Repair we see it as a challenge and even FUN! We are constantly investing in specialty tools and manuals.

<P>Like Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High said, 'I can fix it!  [We have] My old man is a television repair man, got the <i>ultimate</i> set of tools!'
 <A Href="http://alanb.com/spicoli/crashed-car.au">Listen to Spicoli</A>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seriously, our mechanics are extremely meticulous. They will treat your ride as if it was their own. No scratch, that, they will treat your bike like it is your mom's! Your bike's systems will be clean and polished inside and out. It will operate better than new! We supply (and ride with on our own bikes) upgraded parts like Jagwire hydraulic lines and fittings and stainless cables, Kool-Stop brake pads and Slick Honey lube, and compressionless brake housing.  Heck, we even mix our grease!  We are picky about small parts like ferrules (housing caps).

<P>We are a service center for <A href="http://www.rohloff.de" >Rohloff</A> hubs! 
<P>We can drill your Rohloff hubshell for 48 spokes.  (please note this will void your warranty, but a new hubshell is only around $200 if it should ever crack.  However, the only Rohloffs that we have ever heard of cracking, are from tandems.   32 spokes may be strong enough, but the durablility is just not there for heavy loads.   The guts of the hub, however, are plenty strong!)

<P><B>Mikey is resurfacing a hub cone, old school. 
<p Align="justify">Most hub races and some, bottom bracket and pedal races can be re-ground. The method is very effective and the results are better than new! Also it is a very nice option on obsolete equiptment that you still want to use. Bring us your pitted bearing race and we will resurface it to Campagnolo quality for only $8 per cone and $15 per BB spindle or $15 per hub cup or headset race.
<P>2007 UPDATE: We now use our <A Href="http://www.rideyourbike.com/images/latherestoration.jpg">Southbend Lathe</A> to rotate the cones.  The pictured method is still very effective, however.
