<H2>Clothing at Aaron's Bicycle Repair</H2>

<P><B>We stock basic bicycle riding gear like helmets, safety vests, gloves and cycling caps.  
<BR>We do not think one needs special clothing to ride a bike.  
<BR>Special clothing and shoes are yet another barrier to enjoy cycling.
<BR>We have even stopped selling shoes in favor of quality flat pedals.

<P>We have the largest (constantly rotating) selection of cotton and wool cycling caps anywhere, with over 300 in stock!
