Baskets, and more!

<P>Meet at the Pergola at First and Yesler in Pioneer Square at noon, leave at 1 PM.  The destination is <A HREF="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=rxswmg4t3q9x&style=o&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=11077325&encType=1">Terminal 107</A>, a very pleasant park hidden among the industry along the Duwamish waterway.

across the West Seattle Bridge and south along West Marginal Way to the park.  
<P>Hope to see you there! -Haulin' Colin
