<P align="justify">Water, mud, road grime, worms, etc. leave the tyre at a tangent (a straight line intersecting a circle). Notice how high up on this bike the mud has gone! It has even been deflected onto the back side of the fender! This is why a fender or mud flap is needed. The initial installation may protect the rider's face and torso, but his/her feet still get wet. 

<P align="justify">Also, it is very important to keep the water, mud and grime off of the drivetrain components. Grime will shorten the chain and cog life substantially. A rear fender flap is only needed if you plan on riding with friends so you don't spray water in the eyes of the rider behind you.
