<P>At ABR, we strive to buy products with less packaging. We buy many items in bulk (chains, cables, bearings, grease, oil, brake pads, etc).  This saves you money too!
<BR>We also offer <a href="refills.shtml" >refills</a> on many products we sell and use in the shop.  
<BR>We try to select products that are durable and high quality so they last longer.  We give companies feedback on their packaging and encourage them to use recycleable and smaller boxes.  We try not to buy products in plastic clamshells.
<BR>We pre-cycle much of the packaging you do not see.  Cassettes and chainrings, for example, come in cardboard boxes, which we recycle for you.
