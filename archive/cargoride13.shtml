<P><H2>Easter Sunday 2008 Cargo Bike Ride</H2>
</center>
<B>

<P>Join us March 23<sup>rd</sup> at the Naked Father and Son Fountain at the entrance to Myrtle Edwards Park. (Alaskan Way & Broad).

<P>Meet at Noon, then we kick around for an hour or so and THEN FOLLOW ADEN!   (Depart at 1:00 PM SHARP so don't be late!)
<P>Word on the street is we are going to Ballard to see a marching band, then to Gasworks Park for the pic-nic.

<p>The theme of the ride is flowers and fresh foods. With a focus on local! (tulips, daffodils, salads, veggies, dumpstered food, homemade etc.) 
<BR>Spring is here and we have much to be grateful for, so we ride and represent! Cargo bike rides are always family oriented.  Bring your own plates, utensils, cups. Leave no trace! While there will be plenty of cargo bikes, this ride is for everyone.  Cargo bikes travel on the slow side (8-10 MPH) and we stay together, but sometimes we don't make it to the proposed location, so be sure to make it to the start!

<BR>These cargo bike rides were a brianchild of Val Kleitz (aka <A HREF="" target=right>The Bikesmith</A>) during Bike Summer held in Seattle in 2005.   <A Href="xtracycleride.shtml" target=right>Pictures of our first ride</A>.  These rides have grown in popularity as bikes that haul have become more available.
