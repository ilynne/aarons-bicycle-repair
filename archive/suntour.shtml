<H3>SunTour Bicycle Parts</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>It wasn't long ago when you were looking for value and
quality in bicycle parts the name SunTour was the brand of choice. SunTour
invented the modern derailleur design and the compact drivetrain (Micro
Drive). Unfortunately in the early 1990s SunTour USA closed its doors and
the parent company in Japan was sold to some folks in Taiwan. The remaining
inventory in Japan was sold to J&amp;B Importers (a wholesale company based
in Miami) and sold off at crazy low prices.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Smart shops stocked up on the key replacement parts,
like shifters, gears and rear derailleurs, because in order for old SunTour
shifting to work properly, all the parts must match. Most of the supply
of old parts has run out. If you need a replacement part for a SunTour
bike over 5 or 6 years old you will have to shop around. Swap meets and ebay are
still good places to find parts. We still stock many SunTour parts. We even have rear derailleurs!

<P>Rivendell Reader. Issue #14 has a whole bike load of SunTour history and facts!

that are 100% Shimano compatible. However the new parts will <U>not</U>
