<BR>Do your hands go numb when you ride? Does your butt hurt? Does your
neck or upper back get tight and hurt when you ride? These and many other
obstacles to riding can be eliminated at Aaron's Bicycle Repair (ABR).
For your hands try a pair of Grandoe brand gloves with a special pad to
eliminate pressure on the Carpal Tunnel (the line down the middle of your
palm where the nerve to your fingers lies). Since everybody's different,
we stock many different seats for men and women and with our Comfort Guaranteed
Seat Policy, saddle pain is a thing of the past. Proper fit is crucial
to comfort. Your back and neck will love you with a taller and/or shorter
stem. Riding a bicycle does not have to be a painful experience.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF070B"><FONT SIZE=+2>Comfort Guaranteed Seat Policy</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>When you buy a seat from ABR it is guaranteed to be comfortable or
you can exchange if for a different model for up to 30 days after your
purchase. You can keep doing this as long as it takes to get comfortable.
All we ask is that the seat be kept like new during your test ride.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0A0A"><FONT SIZE=+2>Learn to Commute!</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>If you would like to ride your bike to work, but don't know how to
start or have questions, then maybe you need a coach. Call the shop and
we will arrange for someone to ride with you on your first day to show
you the ropes. All of us here @ ABR have always ridden to work and can
show you all the tricks to make your ride safe, quick and comfortable.
You will save money and probably time by riding your bike to work, let
us show you how. We have <B>free</B> bike maps of Seattle and Bellevue.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0710"><FONT SIZE=+2>ISTEA Reauthorization</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>Now is the time to call or write your congress person and urge them
to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, the
law that since 1990 has allocated money to pedestrian and bicycle paths
making biking and walking safer and more available. The decisions on where
to spend the money is left to the local communities not bureaucrats who
don't live here. For more info stop by the shop or check out the <A HREF="http://www.bicyclealliance.org">Now
Bike </A>website for a sample letter and addresses.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0AFF"><B>Update: </B>Success!&nbsp; Thanks for all your
help! The new ISTEA passed! It is now called TEA 21 and has billions of
dollars for bicycle and pedestrian projects to make our communities more
livable. Call your congress person and tell them you support bicycle projects.
Contact Cascade Bicycle Club or The Bicycle Alliance of Washington (formerly
NowBike) for more ways you can get involved.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1115"><FONT SIZE=+2>West Seattle needs a BMX track!</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>If you are interested in getting involved call the shop and we'll put
your name in a database to keep you informed. If you (parents) would like
to spearhead this project call Aaron at 938-9795. BMX, a sport invented
by kids in the '70's, is as safe as baseball and gives kids that are not
interested in traditional team sports a physical outlet. It promotes self
confidence, fitness, and FUN. BMX races have categories for all ages and
for boys and girls.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0C14"><FONT SIZE=+2>Video Vault has Props</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>Check out the West Seattle Video Vault across from the shop for the
latest issue of Props. See amazing footage of Air Shows and flatland stunts
as well as the latest BMX race coverage. Interviews and craziness make
Props a must see! New issues every 2 months. Also check out the mountain
bike action movies Tread and ReTread.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1C20"><FONT SIZE=+2>Winter Biking</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Cycling in Seattle during winter is a wet and dark proposition. However,
it can be done safely and comfortably with lights and fenders. Most bikes
will accept fenders and all will take lights. Most water comes off the
street while riding (can you say rooster tail?) and lights help you to
be seen not just light your way. A front light visible from 500 feet and
a rear reflector visible from 600 feet are required by law for all bicycles
out from 1 hour after dusk until 1 hour before dawn or when ever conditions
merit ( just like a car!) Bicycle have all the same rights and responsibilities
as all other vehicles using the road. ABR carries a full selection of lights,
reflectors, fenders and other safety devices.
