<P><H3>Meet at Noon</H3> 

<P>Stock up early and come with us for a relaxing ride on Buy Nothing Day!
Meet at noon on Nov. 28th, Friday, to burn off some calories from the national Day of Feasting while avoiding the crazed hordes of shopping zombies.
<P>We will start in Red Square on the U of W campus, leaving as close to 1:00 PM as possible, and will proceed at a leisurely pace to Seward park for warm beverages and sustenance.
<P>Bring: yourselves, your families, your friends, your cargo bikes, warm clothing, charcoal, beverages suitable for serving warm, leftovers from the day before, and anything else you can think of to raise our spirits for the final season of the year!
